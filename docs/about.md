# About miga

A minimal data schema to increase the transparency of grant applications, while protecting their confidentiality and the privacy of their applicants.

[The schema is available](https://github.com/grant-applications-data/miga/tree/main/project) in several schema frameworks (JSON Schema, Protobuf and GraphQL), linked data standards (JSON-LD context which provides mapping from JSON to RDF, ShEx, SHACL and OWL), language-specific object models (Python classes, Java classes) and database representations (SQL DDL).
