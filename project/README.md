# Code generated from the linkML model

This directory holds the output generated with [LinkML generators](https://linkml.io/linkml/generators/index.html)
from the model in `src/miga/schema/miga.yaml`.


It currently stores several schema frameworks (JSON Schema, Protobuf and GraphQL), linked data standards (JSON-LD context which provides mapping from JSON to RDF, ShEx, SHACL and OWL), language-specific object models (Python classes, Java classes) and database representations (SQL DDL).
